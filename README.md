# Accalculator

Accalculator is a multifaceted Swift project designed to offer a comprehensive calculator app that goes beyond traditional calculations. It's not just "a calculator"; it's a fusion of "accumulate" and "calculator," symbolizing the app's capability to handle a wide array of computational tasks efficiently.

## Features

Accalculator encompasses several powerful features, including:

- **Regular Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced functions for scientific computation.
- **Conversion Calculator**: Easily converts between various units of measurement, including temperature, length, volume, and more, making it a versatile tool for students, professionals, and everyday users.
- **Tips and Split Calculator**: A handy tool for quickly calculating tips and splitting bills, perfect for dining out or group activities.
- **Scientific Calculations**: Supports advanced mathematical functions, including trigonometric functions, exponents, and logarithms, catering to more complex calculation needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Accalculator is to create a single app that caters to various calculation needs, from basic arithmetic to more complex scientific calculations and unit conversions. By combining these functionalities into one app, Accalculator aims to be a comprehensive tool for users seeking a one-stop solution for their calculation needs.

## Technologies

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for developing Accalculator, chosen for its efficiency and strong support for iOS app development.

## Project Management Report: Calculator App Development

### Introduction

This report outlines the development process of a calculator app, named "Accalculator," using Swift and SwiftUI. The project aimed not only to build a functional calculator app with additional features like measurement conversions and a tip and split bill calculator but also to analyze and estimate the development time, track progress, and understand the challenges encountered during the development process. Emphasis was placed on the learning process of Swift and SwiftUI, given my prior inexperience with these technologies.

### Time Estimation

The initial time estimation for the project was as follows:

- Learning Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode: 3-4 hours.
- Development: 24 hours.
- Testing and UI Adjustments: 8-12 hours.

### Actual Time Spent and Activities

#### February 6-8

The total time spent so far for each phase and in total are as follows:

- **Learning Phase:** ~3.72 hours
- **Development Phase:** ~9 hours
- **Testing and Documentation Phase:** ~6.27 hours

This results in a **total time spent of approximately 18.98 hours** on the project so far.

##### Learning Phase

- **Feb 6, 6:00 PM - 9:43 PM:** Studied Swift and SwiftUI using Apple Developer tutorials and created an example application. Total time: 3 hours 43 minutes.

##### Development Phase

- **Feb 6, 10:52 PM - Feb 7, 12:53 AM:** Researched calculator UI examples, created the app, and started with the regular calculator view. Total time: 2 hours 1 minute.
- **Feb 7, 9:35 AM - 10:00 AM:** UI development for the conversion calculator. Total time: 25 minutes.
- **Feb 7, 11:58 AM - 1:17 PM:** Completed UI and functionality for the conversion calculator. Total time: 1 hour 19 minutes.
- **Feb 7, 2:18 PM - 3:05 PM:** Researched and designed the UI for the tip and bill splitter. Total time: 47 minutes.
- **Feb 7, 3:05 PM - 4:38 PM:** Researched and started developing the currency converter (later removed). Total time: 1 hour 33 minutes.
- **Feb 7, 8:45 PM - 9:35 PM:** Decision to remove the currency converter feature. Total time: 50 minutes.

##### Testing and Documentation

- **Feb 7, 9:55 PM - 10:01 PM:** Documenting and publishing to GitHub. Total time: 6 minutes.
- **Feb 7, 10:02 PM - 11:32 PM:** Functionality testing and bug fixing. Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes.
- **Feb 8, 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM:** Created the app logo. Total time: 30 minutes.
- **Feb 8, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM:** Fixed bugs related to expression and decimal issues. Total time: 1 hour.
- **Feb 8, 6:00 PM - 6:30 PM:** Researched handling invalid expressions without external libraries. Total time: 30 minutes.
- **Feb 8, 7:56 PM - 8:45 PM:** Documenting progress. Total time: 49 minutes.

### Bug Tracking and Resolution

Several bugs were encountered and addressed, including issues with decimal calculations, handling invalid operations, and UI layout challenges when switching to landscape mode. Specific solutions were implemented, such as appending `.0` to integers to ensure floating-point operations and improving expression validation to alert users of invalid inputs.

### Comparison and Analysis

The actual time spent on learning, development, and testing exceeded the initial estimates, primarily due to the inclusion of additional features and the need to address unforeseen bugs. The learning phase was within the estimated range, but the development and testing phases required more time for research, feature adjustments, and bug fixes.

### Conclusion

The development of the Accalculator app provided valuable insights into project management, the importance of accurate time estimation, and the challenges of learning new technologies. The project highlighted the need for flexible planning, thorough testing, and continuous learning. These experiences will be instrumental in improving future software development projects.
